tbr_pointer
===========

**tbr_pointer** is a simple visual aid for ArmA3, giving players a way to point out/mark positions to their team-mates.

The pointer shapes has a 10 second lifetime (and you can only point out one thing at the time, pointing to a new location before the lifetime is up, resets the clock).

The menu-actions are bound to User15 and User16 actions as well, for quick activation.
